# TARDIS CHALLANGE

### Backend part

The project involves the creation of an innovative chatbot that will be integrated directly into the developer's website, <br />
providing users with the convenience and speed of information exchange. The core of this chatbot is based on the powerful `GPT API` language model,
which analyzes all customer project documentation and answers users' questions, <br />
providing them with informative answers. <br />
Interaction with the language model takes place through a convenient pop-up window that is localized directly on the company's website to ensure maximum accessibility and efficiency of interaction for users.
